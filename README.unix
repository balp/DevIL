How do I compile the 3 libraries ?
-----------------------------------------

Just type ./configure && make. It should find automatically what can
(or cannot) be built on your system.

NB : ./configure --help gives you all compiling options available for the three
      libs. This includes enabling/disabling picture formats, ilut apis.
      
Enable/Disable:
The disabilitable features are basically enabled, a test will be performed
to verify if is possible to compile them in. If they are explicitely enabled
or disabled no test will occour.


Libraries needed to compile DevIL* :
-----------------------------------

They are all autodetected by the ./configure script. But if you want to include
one of those format, you have just to install the corresponding lib :

(libs listed in libraries.txt)

or in your distro/port ftp/site/whatever_you_want :-)


Installation:
-------------

If #make succeeded, just type #make install, followed by #ldconfig
(as su, of course)
