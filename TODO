DevIL TODO:

-----------

Denton:
- Add ilIsValid* for .icns and .jp2 (and more?)
- Get MNG support working again.
- Better static lib support in MSVC++ 8/9
- Commenting out lines 729-731 in pngread.c of libpng will allow reading of certain malformed Vista PNG-compressed .ico files with extra data at the end of the stream.  An example can be found in test/in and was created using Microangelo.
- Linking against debug OpenEXR in release DevIL will crash and vice-versa.
- Add .hdr saving.
- Add .ico/.icns saving.
- Add .exr saving.
- Add .jp2 saving.
- Fix Daniel's suggestions.
- Possibly readd VC6 projects?
- Enable descriptive error strings in IL.
- Return UNICODE strings when needed.
- Progressive saving of JPG.
- Lib EXIF support
- FITS support
- APNG support
- D language support
- Fortran support
- JP2 and EXR loading from file streams.
- Librsvg
- Readd CMAKE support
- .iff support?
- Respond to all forum requests.
- Add BeOS support back in?


For 1.7.0
- fixed OpenGL Loading (breaks old code which inverted the images)
- iluReplaceColour should have a color to describe which color to set.
- ilBindImage must return a result. It may fail!
- ilInit() call iSetImage0 and ilBindTemp. This shouldn't happen and image names must start from 0
- Rename iGetIntegervImage to ilGetImageIntegerv and make it public

Features to be added
- global use of restricted pointers where available (for now only il_bmp.{c,h} uses it)
- Add a real Layer facility.
- iluScaleColours is BUGGED, doesn't handle the image with the correct type! more Bpc (except luminance and paletted one)
- IL_LUMINANCE_ALPHA support must be tested in ilApplyPal();
- ilApplyPal should work on any type of image, not only IL_BYTE or IL_UNSIGNED_BYTE
- IL_COLOUR_INDEX:  must be implemented in iluReplaceColour(ILubyte Red, ILubyte Green, ILubyte Blue, ILfloat Tolerance);
- Check saving of Luminance (8 bpp/1 Bpp) BMP
- ilKeyColor ilAddKey...
- iluRotate3D
- iluEqualize must be implemented for various Bpc
- Add more filters.  Some sites to look at are http://www.jasonwaltman.com/thesis/introduction.html http://www.dai.ed.ac.uk/CVonline/transf.htm http://www.fortunecity.com/lavendar/kane/39/ffpg.htm and http://www.opengl.org/developers/documentation/Version1.2/1.2specs/convolution_border_modes.txt .  The last link describes ways to handle borders for the convolution filters.  It might be worthwhile to allow these kinds of options.
- Add support for callbacks so that users can create progress meters for loading and saving in their applications.  We could extend this idea further and allow cancellation of loading/saving images.
- Add an IL_BITMAP format.  This would be great for WBMP files.  The problem is that bit manipulation can be extremely tedious, even with macros.
- Make better versions of the DevIL ports of the NeHe tutorials.  Several of the tutorials don't call ilInit, for instance.
- Add support for volume texture compression (VTC).
- Find a way to make the filters (especially the convolution filters) work in three dimensions.
- Finish support for regions in ILU.
- Add support for regions in IL.  This could be used to save only a specific portion of an image.
- Add support for user-defined filters (possibly of a user-defined size).
- Update the state stack in IL.  Right now, it only saves part of the states when you push/pop.
- Check compatibility with all the files in the BMP Suite.
- Work on making DevIL more stable.  There's probably a few places where I don't check the return value of ilNewImage, for instance.
- Add dithering.
- Look at .cgm support.
- Add padding options, so that each line could be DWORD-padded, for instance.
- Work on better .tif loading and saving.  DevIL needs to use lower-level libtiff functions to accomplish this.
- Find a better algorithm for generating DXTC textures.
- Fix problems loading .dds files on Big Endian machines.
- Work on the signed/unsigned conversions a bit more (IL_BYTE versus IL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, etc.).  A good link for defining signed formats is http://www.sgi.com/software/opengl/advanced98/notes/node31.html .
- Possibly add support for other colour spaces besides RGB (CMYK, YUV, etc.)
- Look at adding FreeType support to ILU.
- Implement a scripting "language" with LUA for ILU.  This way, people can generate scripts to run a certain set of filters on all images.
- Add clipboard and printing support in Linux.
- Add TWAIN support.
- Look at other rescaling algorithms:
