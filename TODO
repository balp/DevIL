DevIL TODO:

-----------

Denton:

Easier:
- iGetString may not work properly with Unicode strings.
- Add ilIsValid* for .jp2 (and more?)
- Fix Daniel's suggestions.
- Added ilSetError error codes to il_files.c.
- Get rid of check for precache.
- If IL_NO_JP2 is defined, lines 306-307 shouldn't just cause the entire thing to fail.  We should just skip that entry.
- Change ilConvertBuffer to be able to convert paletted images as well.
- Update DevIL website with file formats (psd-saving, etc.).
- Add more extensions to top of il_states.c.
- Change line 66 of ilut_opengl.c if none of those are defined.
- Do we need IL_TEXT stuff in ilut_internal.h?  Seems Linux is left out there...
- Fix MSVC8 solutions for text files.
- Warnings on Mac OS X.
- Change config.h.win. - Also add Squish to it.

- Update MSVC8 solutions to include il_size.c.


More involved:
- ilSaveF and ilSaveL may just be returning boolean values.
- It looks like ilSetRead/ilSetWrite don't actually do anything.
- Run Valgrind on library.
- Make iSaveJp2Internal and iSaveExrInternal work with palettes (make ilConvertBuffer work on palettes as well).
- Make .ico/.icns uses Mipmaps field instead for smaller icons (can icns have multiple images?).
- Work on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Icon_Image page.
- Commenting out lines 729-731 in pngread.c of libpng (1.2.9?) will allow reading of certain malformed Vista PNG-compressed .ico files with extra data at the end of the stream.  An example can be found in test/in and was created using Microangelo.
- Add .ico/.icns saving.
- Readd CMAKE support
- Better static lib support in MSVC++ 8/9
- Lib EXIF support
- FITS support
- APNG support
- Fortran support
- D language support - There exists a program to convert C headers to D.
- Better DirectX 10 support
- Should probably check for errors in iGetWdpHead and etc...
- ilGetAlpha returns malloc'ed memory that cannot be freed by the caller.
- Support for DX10 .dds files
- More checks for headers of unknown file types
- Set CompSize in ReadData of il_dds.c for DDS_LINEARSIZE flag?
- Look at resize filters in VTFEdit.
- Get rid of globals in il_dds.c.
- TIFF with JPEG encoding
- Bicubic scaling
- Use glTexImage3D and update OpenGL calls.
- Freebasic support
- Reorder loading/saving in il_io.c
- Get il_vtf.c to do less memory allocation.  Just use the precache function.
- In il_gif.c, make sure subimages with offsets will not lead to an overflow.
- il_bmp.c / il_dds.c / il_dds-save.c may not be safe for Big Endian for 16-bit data.
- Change how mipmaps are stored (do not use Next pointer in ILimage).
- Check ASCII PPM code for the ability to read data that wraps around to multiple lines.
- cubemap.hdr.vtf does not load.
- Check return on all ilFixImage calls.
- Printing not working from Windows test.
- Add function to create cubemaps
- Request compressed texture data in ilutGLSetTex2D?
- Upload cubemaps directly to OpenGL/D3D.
- Change some calls (such as in il_tiff.c) to ilGetString to non-Unicode.
- Check saving of Luminance (8 bpp/1 Bpp) BMP
- Check compatibility with all the files in the BMP Suite.
- IL_COLOUR_INDEX:  must be implemented in iluReplaceColour(ILubyte Red, ILubyte Green, ILubyte Blue, ILfloat Tolerance);
- iluEqualize must be implemented for various Bpc
- Update the state stack in IL.  Right now, it only saves part of the states when you push/pop.
- Redo Compress in il_dds-save.c.
- Check 16-bit images being loaded have their lower bits properly set.  An example is the il_dds.c entry on 2009-01-15.
- Fix image loading problems listed on http://www.seriema.net/thumbview/index.php?page=compatibility.
- Fix iluRotate_ - it shifts images by a pixel each direction sometimes.
- Look at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_graphics_file_formats
- Use IL_HALF format internally.


Lots of work:
- Linux Unicode support is partially broken.
- Write own .exr routines.
- Native WDP support
- Enable descriptive error strings in IL.
- Librsvg
- Give estimates for buffer sizes for ilSaveL.
- MNG saving
- Thread safe version
- Add flag for determining whether DDS data is outdated.
- TIFF saving to file streams and lumps
- Use fseek/ftell 64-bit?
- Check for any external library pointers that are assumed to be 32-bit.
- Possibly make palettes always 768 (or 1024) bytes so that it is not possible to access outside by bad data?
- Add padding options, so that each line could be DWORD-padded, for instance.
- Add dithering.
- Work on making DevIL more stable.  There's probably a few places where I don't check the return value of ilNewImage, for instance.
- Add support for callbacks so that users can create progress meters for loading and saving in their applications.  We could extend this idea further and allow cancellation of loading/saving images.
- global use of restricted pointers where available (for now only il_bmp.{c,h} uses it)
- iluScaleColours is BUGGED, doesn't handle the image with the correct type! more Bpc (except luminance and paletted one)
- Add a real Layer facility.
- IL_LUMINANCE_ALPHA support must be tested in ilApplyPal();
- ilApplyPal should work on any type of image, not only IL_BYTE or IL_UNSIGNED_BYTE
- Look at adding FreeType support to ILU.
- Work on the signed/unsigned conversions a bit more (IL_BYTE versus IL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, etc.).  A good link for defining signed formats is http://www.sgi.com/software/opengl/advanced98/notes/node31.html .
- Add TWAIN support.
- Add clipboard and printing support in Linux.
- Finish support for regions in ILU.
- Add support for regions in IL.  This could be used to save only a specific portion of an image.
- Add support for user-defined filters (possibly of a user-defined size).
- Add more filters.  Some sites to look at are http://www.jasonwaltman.com/thesis/introduction.html http://www.dai.ed.ac.uk/CVonline/transf.htm http://www.fortunecity.com/lavendar/kane/39/ffpg.htm and http://www.opengl.org/developers/documentation/Version1.2/1.2specs/convolution_border_modes.txt .  The last link describes ways to handle borders for the convolution filters.  It might be worthwhile to allow these kinds of options.
- Possibly add support for other colour spaces besides RGB (CMYK, YUV, etc.)
- Implement a scripting "language" with LUA for ILU.  This way, people can generate scripts to run a certain set of filters on all images.
- Look at other rescaling algorithms:

http://www.npac.syr.edu/projects/nasa/MILOJE/final/node36.html
http://www.ultranet.com/~aramini/design.html
- ilKeyColor ilAddKey...
- Find a way to make the filters (especially the convolution filters) work in three dimensions.
- Make better versions of the DevIL ports of the NeHe tutorials.  Several of the tutorials don't call ilInit, for instance.
- Change parameters of iread to use ILsizei.
- Make sure all bugs in bug tracker are squashed.


Questions:
- Possibly readd VC6 projects?
- Add BeOS support back in?
- Create Dev-C++/MingW/Cygwin .a files for releases?
- Does ilIsValidTga generate an unncessary IL_INVALID_EXTENSION error?
- Why is IL_HALF even used in ilut_directx9.c?
- Should iluScale act on faces and mipmaps?
- Fix problems loading .dds files on Big Endian machines (still a problem or not?)
- Reimplement DXT2/DXT4 saving?
- Should we be calculating DXT endpoints before converting data to 565 format?
- Use Extreme DXT compression code?
- Support half data internally?


From old TODO:
For 1.7.0
- fixed OpenGL Loading (breaks old code which inverted the images)
- iluReplaceColour should have a color to describe which color to set.
- ilBindImage must return a result. It may fail!
- ilInit() call iSetImage0 and ilBindTemp. This shouldn't happen and image names must start from 0
- Rename iGetIntegervImage to ilGetImageIntegerv and make it public

Matej:
- Make a test suite
- Make a simple command-line ILU frontend (iller)
- Make DevIL parts that require external libraries modular
- Make the library include files correct (fix the config.h problem)
- Fix the fact that --enable-debug configure switch is ineffective since -g -O2 somehow leaks to CFLAGS during configure...
